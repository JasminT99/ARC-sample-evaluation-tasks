# ARC-sample-evaluation-tasks
Having a background in human intelligence testing, I’m currently investigating the relation of ARC tasks to human fluid intelligence. Furthermore, I’m interested in tasks where humans outperform machines and the reasons behind it. 
To incorporate insights from the latest ARC models, I aim to collect top model performance regarding whether the model was correct at shots 1, 2, and 3, along with the computation time for the evaluation task names uploaded xlsx file.
